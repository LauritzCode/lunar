# ðŸŒ™ Lunar Exercise

## Description 
This project is a small C program that simulates a simple control system for a thruster. The function takes an altitude value as input and decides whether the thruster should be on or off. If the altitude is greater than 100 or less than or equal to 0, the thruster stays off. Otherwise, the thruster is turned on.
